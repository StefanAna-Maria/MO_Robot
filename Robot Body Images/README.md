# Construction of the Robot's Body

The robot's body was entirely handcrafted using materials and paint sourced from the Leroy Merlin DIY store. I have attached both the design I created and images of the final product for each part of its body. The robot's body consists of the torso, a head with a movable mouth, two arms, one leg, and wheels at the base of the leg.

# Used Materials 

## Head and Mouth:

- A 75 mm diameter pipe for the head and mouth.
- Half of a plastic globe to create a hemisphere for the top of the head.

## Arms:

- An unjointed tube with a 13 mm diameter for the main arm.
- A curved pipe for the shoulder to connect the arm to the torso.

## Torso:

- An uneven pipe with a base diameter of 11 cm.
- Expanded polystyrene for filling the pipe ends, used to secure the neck and leg to the torso.

## Leg:

- A 55 mm diameter pipe
