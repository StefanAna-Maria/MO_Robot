# MO_Robot
Final project developed for the IR course.

  <summary>Introduction</summary>

## Ideea and Motivation:
The MO Robotics Project is inspired by the character MO from the animated series "Robotzi" by Creative Monkeys. MO is a quirky, humorous robot who works alongside his friend F.O.C.A in an experimental laboratory. In the series, MO is the more laid-back and scatterbrained of the duo, often causing trouble that F.O.C.A is left to fix. My project aims to bring MO to life by building a functional robot that captures his playful personality and clumsy charm.

This project is particularly meaningful to me as it allows me to combine my passion for robotics with nostalgic memories of a series I enjoyed watching during my childhood. By recreating MO, I hope to celebrate the creativity and humor of "Robotzi" while showcasing the potential of robotics to bring beloved characters to life.

## Functionality:
The MO Robot is designed as a faithful representation of the beloved character from the animated series Robotzi.

### The robot will feature:

- A single leg for mobility or stability.
- Two functional arms.
- LED matrix eyes capable of displaying animations.
- A mouth that can open and close.

### MO will have the ability to:

- Speak iconic lines from the series, capturing the character's humor and personality.
- Display eye animations using the LED matrix.
- Be controlled via a controller or remote, allowing for interactive operation.

### Additionally, MO will be programmed to interact with another robot, F.O.C.A.:

- Dialogue Mode: MO will engage in conversations with F.O.C.A.
