  <summary>Introduction</summary>

  The MO Robotics Project is inspired by the character MO from the animated series "Robotzi" by Creative Monkeys. MO is a quirky, humorous robot who works alongside his friend F.O.C.A in an experimental laboratory. In the series, MO is the more laid-back and scatterbrained of the duo, often causing trouble that F.O.C.A is left to fix. My project aims to bring MO to life by building a functional robot that captures his playful personality and clumsy charm.

This project is particularly meaningful to me as it allows me to combine my passion for robotics with nostalgic memories of a series I enjoyed watching during my childhood. By recreating MO, I hope to celebrate the creativity and humor of "Robotzi" while showcasing the potential of robotics to bring beloved characters to life.
